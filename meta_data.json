    "description": "This plugin provides a persistent countdown timer element that leverages cookies to maintain its state even after the page is reloaded.\n\nIt allows you to configure a custom duration and assign a unique ID to each instance, ensuring multiple timers can operate independently.\n\nWith built-in events such as Timer Updated and Timer Finished, you can seamlessly integrate dynamic workflows that respond as the timer counts down or completes.",
